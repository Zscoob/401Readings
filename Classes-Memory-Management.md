# Classes & Memory Management
Class 4, 401 readings

## Reference Types
  - A type that is defined as a class is a reference type
  - At run time, when you declare a variable of a reference type
  - the variable contains the value null until you explicitly create an instance of the class by using the new operator

## Declaring Classes
  - classes are declared by the keyword Class followed by and identifier
    - public class ThisIdentifier 

  - public is before class but could also be private

## Creating objects
  - Although they are sometimes used interchangeably, a class and an object are different things.
  - A class defines a type of object, but it is not an object itself. 
  - Objects can be created by using the new keyword followed by the name of the class that the object will be based on
    ThisIdentifie object1 = new identity();
  - When an instance of a class is created, a reference to the object is passed back to the programmer.
