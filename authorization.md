# Role-based authorization in ASP.NET Core
## Adding role checks
Role-based authorization checks are declarativeâ€”the developer embeds them within their code, against a controller or an action within a controller, specifying roles which the current user must be a member of to access the requested resource.

For example, the following code limits access to any actions on the AdministrationController to users who are a member of the Administrator role:

          [Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
          public class AdministrationController : Controller
          {
          }

You can specify multiple roles as a comma separated list:

          [Authorize(Roles = "HRManager,Finance")]
          public class SalaryController : Controller
          {
          }

This controller would be only accessible by users who are members of the HRManager role or the Finance role.

If you apply multiple attributes then an accessing user must be a member of all the roles specified; the following sample requires that a user must be a member of both the PowerUser and ControlPanelUser role.

          [Authorize(Roles = "PowerUser")]
          [Authorize(Roles = "ControlPanelUser")]
          public class ControlPanelController : Controller
          {
          }

You can further limit access by applying additional role authorization attributes at the action level:

          [Authorize(Roles = "Administrator, PowerUser")]
          public class ControlPanelController : Controller
          {
              public ActionResult SetTime()
              {
              }

              [Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
              public ActionResult ShutDown()
              {
              }
          }

In the previous code snippet members of the Administrator role or the PowerUser role can access the controller and the SetTime action, but only members of the Administrator role can access the ShutDown action.

You can also lock down a controller but allow anonymous, unauthenticated access to individual actions.

          [Authorize]
          public class ControlPanelController : Controller
          {
              public ActionResult SetTime()
              {
              }

              [AllowAnonymous]
              public ActionResult Login()
              {
              }
          }

For Razor Pages, the AuthorizeAttribute can be applied by either:
  - Using a convention
  - Applying the AuthorizeAttribute to the PageModel instance:

          [Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdministratorRole")]
          public class UpdateModel : PageModel
          {
              public ActionResult OnPost()
              {
              }
          }

  *** Filter attributes, including AuthorizeAttribute, can only be applied to PageModel and cannot be applied to specific page handler methods. ***

## Policy based role checks

Role requirements can also be expressed using the new Policy syntax, where a developer registers a policy at startup as part of the Authorization service configuration. This normally occurs in ConfigureServices() in your Startup.cs file.

          public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
          {
              services.AddControllersWithViews();
              services.AddRazorPages();

              services.AddAuthorization(options =>
              {
                  options.AddPolicy("RequireAdministratorRole",
                      policy => policy.RequireRole("Administrator"));
              });
          }

Policies are applied using the Policy property on the AuthorizeAttribute attribute:

          [Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdministratorRole")]
          public IActionResult Shutdown()
          {
              return View();
          }

If you want to specify multiple allowed roles in a requirement then you can specify them as parameters to the RequireRole method:

          options.AddPolicy("ElevatedRights", policy =>
                  policy.RequireRole("Administrator", "PowerUser", "BackupAdministrator"));

This example authorizes users who belong to the Administrator, PowerUser or BackupAdministrator roles.

          public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
          {
              services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
                  options.UseSqlServer(
                      Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
              services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>()
                  .AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
                  .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();

              services.AddControllersWithViews();
              services.AddRazorPages();
          }
