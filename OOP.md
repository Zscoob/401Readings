# Object Oriented Programming
  - computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
    -An object is a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
  - focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 
    - this makes solving larger complex problems easier
  - Code is more reusable, scaleable and efficent when practicing OOP

## The Four principles of OOP 
  - Encapsilation
    - The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class.
    - Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods. 
    - data-hiding provides a more secure program abd helps avoid data corruption

  - Abstraction
    - Objects only reveal internal mechanisms relevant of their use of other objects and hide unnecessary code.
      - allows easier additional changes.

  - Inheritabce
    - Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. 

  - Polymorphism
    - Objects can take on more than one form depending on the context.
    - cuts down on duplicate code
