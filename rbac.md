## rbac
Through RBAC, you can control what end-users can do at both broad and granular levels. You can designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user, and align roles and access permissions with your employees’ positions in the organization. Permissions are allocated only with enough access as needed for employees to do their jobs.

What if an end-user's job changes? You may need to manually assign their role to another user, or you can also assign roles to a role group or use a role assignment policy to add or remove members of a role group.

Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
Management role group – you can add and remove members.
Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.
By adding a user to a role group, the user has access to all the roles in that group. If they are removed, access becomes restricted. Users may also be assigned to multiple groups in the event they need temporary access to certain data or programs and then removed once the project is complete.

Other options for user access may include:

Primary – the primary contact for a specific account or role.
Billing – access for one end-user to the billing account.
Technical – assigned to users that perform technical tasks.
Administrative – access for users that perform administrative tasks.
